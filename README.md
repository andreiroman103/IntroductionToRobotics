# Introduction To Robotics (2021 - 2022)
Homeworks and projects for the "Introduction To Robotics" course, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathemtics and Computer Science. The homeworks and projects will consist of code, image files and documentation. This is my first contact with robotics and Arduino and I want to make the most of it.
